# HTTP.Mojo

This is a simple Mojo wrapper over Python sockets. The idea is to build a simple reusable library to send and receive data over TCP/IP socket connections. The broader intention is to build a library that others can refer and build on top of. The library is organized into following:

1. HTTPRequest
2. HTTPResponse
3. HTTPServer
4. HTTPClient
5. Headers
